# The Dream Portal

This is a simple web app that accepts a dream description and returns
a reflective interpretation using generative AI. 

## Purpose
It is an ongoing personal project with many iterations to come. I have been using generative AI as a reflection tool for a while due to its innate ability to recognize patterns, access mythic structures, and mirror our own language back to us. So, I wanted to start building a mini app to merge my personal interests with my technical education. 

## What is required to run this? 
- OpenAi API key 
- Python
- any web browser (it runs using flask on your loopback address)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`as an environment variable
4. Run `python3 app.py`
5. copy and paste the address and port into the browser
6. play! 
   
## The Future of this project
- expand UI/UX 
- store dreams 
- create journal function
- find patterns in reoccuring themes 
  
  
  ## Future Improvements
- Improve and expand on UI/UX
- Add a feature which will store past dreams 
- Add support for identifying recurring themes and symbols across multiple dream entries
- Explore basic pattern analysis to highlight repeated emotional tones or imagery over time
